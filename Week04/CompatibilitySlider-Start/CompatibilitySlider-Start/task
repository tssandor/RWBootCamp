When the user opens the app, the top label should say “User 1, what do you think
about...”

The label with stars next to it should have the name of the first item in the
`compatibilityItems` array.

The user can move the slider and give that item a score between 1 and 5.

When the user presses the “next item” button, you need to save their score for that first
item as a dictionary.

○ Hint:
let currentItem = compatibilityItems[currentItemIndex]
currentPerson?.items.updateValue(slider.value, forKey: currentItem)

After you save that info, go on to the next item in the array for Person1. A good way to
keep track of what item you’re on is to increase `currentItemIndex` after you save the
info.

When you get to the last item in the array, change the currentUser to person2, change
the top label to say “Person 2, how do you feel about...”, start the array over, and do the
exact same thing as before.

When you have finished with person 2, calculate both users compatibility scores and
show a UIAlert telling the users their score.

Reset the game to the beginning when the UIAlert comes up.

Make sure to test your code a few times before you submit it, and watch out for crashes.
If you try to access `compatibilityItems[currentItemIndex]` but `currentItemIndex` is a
higher index than the last item in the array, you’ll crash your app!
